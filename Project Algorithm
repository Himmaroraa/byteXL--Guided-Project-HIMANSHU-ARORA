Airline Passenger Referal Prediction Algorithm

1. Data Collection: Gather data from various sources, including customer reviews and airline websites.

2. Data Preprocessing:
(a) Clean the data by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
(b) Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information and create new features.
(c) Encode categorical variables into numerical representations.
(d) Select the most important features using feature selection techniques.

3. Model Selection: Choose appropriate classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

4. Model Training: Train the selected models using the preprocessed data.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like Recall, Accuracy, and ROC AUC.
7. Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model for predicting passenger referrals.
